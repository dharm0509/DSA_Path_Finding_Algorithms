# DSA_Path_Finding_Algorithms
A Pygame-based pathfinding visualizer for A*, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, and Greedy Best-First Search — visualize how algorithms explore the grid in real time.


# 🧭 Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer (Pygame)

This project showcases **five popular pathfinding algorithms** implemented using **Python and Pygame**, each in its own file for clarity and modular understanding.

> 👁️ Visualize how each algorithm explores the grid and finds the shortest path — all in real time.
